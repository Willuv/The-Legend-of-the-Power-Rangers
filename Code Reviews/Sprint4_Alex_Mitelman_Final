	Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:
	The code structure and its handling of collisions and events in AllCollisionsHandler is clear and efficient. 
	Additionally, the EnsureOrder() method is clear in how it standardizes the input for collision handling to check object orders against the dictionary.

	Specific comments on code quality:
	Overall, the code quality is very good. The code inlcudes commented-out debug lines that are useful in understanding the broader context of the code, even if not in use. 
	A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current:
	If there were additional interactions between game objects that needed to be added, the current code structure can easily be extended to do so.
	Unless said interactions are too complicated, needing additional logic to be added, extending the events list should accommodate new types of objects without much difficulty.
