	The code in the GameStateMachine file is very organized and easily readable. All the variables and function names are descriptive 
	and coencide with the correct functionality.

	The code in the GameStatemachine file is very high quality. It isn't too complex and is easy to build on if you wanted to add new states to the game.
	One thing that I might do differently to improve code quality is to create an update state for each state that updates all the necessary components so that the update function 
	looks cleaner.
