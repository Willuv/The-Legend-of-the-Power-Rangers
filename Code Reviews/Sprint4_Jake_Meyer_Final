	The method names are pretty readable, along with most variable names. A lot of magic numbers, though.
	I'm guessing that the 705 and 505 numbers are the positions of the item selection boxes, but it's
	very hard to actually know. I also don't really understand why one method has 705 and 505, while the
	other has 705 505 and 605. Overall though, eliminating the magic numbers would make this much much
	more readable. The layout and other elements are readable without those numbers. Also, I'm really not
	sure what Update does in this instance, such as what reverse is for.

	I've already talked about the readability so I won't reiterate, tho the readability makes it hard to
	understand the quality. As for quality, the class is pretty short which is good. Methods are concise.
	A few instances of commented out code, though I've done the same. Count is unused so it can go. Not sure
	what the purpose of the default case in ChooseActiveItem is, but could be for debugging. And one small 
	thing that isn't a big deal: Inconsistent with where things get initialized vs declared. Some are initialized
	in the constructor, some before it. I've done the same thing a few times.
