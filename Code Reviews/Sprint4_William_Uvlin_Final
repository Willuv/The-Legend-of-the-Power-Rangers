	Overall Christian made the camera class relatively easy to read. As someone who did not work on managing the camera this sprint,
	by reading through the class I was able to gain a good understanding on how it works. The methods in the class are well named and describe
	what the methods do. Some parts of the file that could have improvements to the readability are setting some of the constant values 
	in the class to variables to allow for quicker understanding.

	This would allow us to keep the functionality of switching rooms while improving readability as well as better coupling and modularity
	There are very few changes I would make to this class. The code will cause the camera to move from one position in space to another, 
	one change could be to split the movement based on direction, that way if there is a bug in the code then it would be easier to spot.
