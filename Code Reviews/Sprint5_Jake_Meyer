	As for readability, the ReadData method is extremely difficult to read. However, that feels pretty expected, seeing as
	it's parsing a .csv file which isn't very readable to humans. The rest of the file is readable. The method names all
	make sense and don't really have any issues. The LoadEnemies is also a little difficult, but due to the csv issue from
	before. Could potentially leave comments for the ReadData and LoadEnemies sections in case anyone else would need to read them.

	Firstly, there is some commented out code that could be removed, or at least explained why it was kept. The load secret room
	section could be streamlined instead of checking in both ReadData and LoadEnemies, but honestly I may have written those
	myself. I was the one in charge of a lot of secret room. I don't remember adding it to LoadEnemies, so it looks as though
	that duplicate call could be removed. The math also seems pretty solid for reading through the csv. Ultimately, this code
	seems pretty efficient.
