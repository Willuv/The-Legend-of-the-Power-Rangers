	Overall pretty readable. A few things though, I’m not too sure what OnSelected is. 
	Looks like maybe it’s when it initially spawned from the content of the method, but unsure what would call it. 
	The commented out section was when we worked on trying to change something together, and can be removed.
	Overall though, the rest is pretty simple and readable.

	All the initialization, OnSelected, TriggerDeath, 
	and fields seem pretty efficient. Especially with only updating frame time unless the enemy is spawning or dying. 
	Some nested if statements but I can’t think of a better way to design them. currentFrameIndex is set to 0 but only in a comment, 
	though the comment says it might be needed. I don’t know how it works but should probably either have the line or not
