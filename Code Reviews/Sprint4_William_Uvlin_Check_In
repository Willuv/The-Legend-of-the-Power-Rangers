	Overall Christian Made the level class relatively easy to read. 
	The class groups variables together that make sense being together. 
	The methods in the level class are named clearly allowing readers to understand the method's purpose. 
	Some parts of the file that could have improvements made to the readability are by splitting up updates into two methods, 
	one to load blocks, and one to load items.

	One hypothetical change to make to the level.cs file and class would be to not “hardcode” the streamreader paths and also put them in level loader. 
	This could be easily implemented by creating a load room function that contains a list of some sorts with all the paths. 
	This would allow us to keep the functionality of switching rooms while improving readability as well as better coupling and modularity
