	Overall Jake made the PortalManager class easy to read. I did not work on this but after reading it for the first time I am able to understand it
	relatively well. The methods in this class are all well named and help describe what each ones job is very accurately. Some parts of the file that
	could have improvements to the readability are to create X and Y position variables for the blue and orange portals instead of using TeleportPosition.X/Y. 
	This would allow for even quicker understanding especially in regards to when link is teleported.

	One hypothetical change I would make to the PortalManager class would be to combine the addBlue/OrangePortal into one general method
	and the same for the handle portals method. This would allow for greater simplicity within the class by reducing any duplicated code
	currently in the code. This change also would allow for easier updates if something about the portal logic needs to be changed
