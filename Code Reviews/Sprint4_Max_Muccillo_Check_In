	Will designed the game state machine as a way to reduce the amount of code in game1 and to keep everything organized in one spot. 
	Will did a good job of making the code in the class readable.

	I've been working in the GameStateMachine file a lot and Will made the code very readable and modular. 
	The way Will designed this class makes it very easy to add new states due to its modular design. 
	One change to improve code quality is to create a separate method that loads all the textures and factories. 
	This way duplicate code won’t be used in other states.
