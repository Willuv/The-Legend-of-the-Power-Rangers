	CollisionManager is very readable, especially the HandleCollision method. 
	HandleCollision is full of comments that make each if statement very clear.

	The code quality is good. There are a few nested ifs, but it feels necessary to a collision manager.
	Looping through loaded objects with nested ifs and checking for collisions seems to be the best way to do it.
	I think that the else for debugging in HandleCollision can be removed.
