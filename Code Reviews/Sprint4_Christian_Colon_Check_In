	CollisionManager is very readable, especially the HandleCollision method. 
	HandleCollision is full of comments that make each if statement very clear.

	The code quality is good. There are a few nested ifs, but it feels necessary to a collision manager.
	Looping through loaded objects with nested ifs and checking for collisions seems to be the best way to do it.
	I think that the else for debugging in HandleCollision can be removed.

	The code is rather readable, a few comments are found to make some Update choices clear as well as what the InitializeFrames are.

	Most of Enemy seems fine, but there seems to be something weird with OnSelected and TriggerDeath. OnSelected never uses the X paramater its asked for.
	Not sure if both methods should be using destinationRectangle values.
	There is an unnecessary commented out TriggerDeath method.
