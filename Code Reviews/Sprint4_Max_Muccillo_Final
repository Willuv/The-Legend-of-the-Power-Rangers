	The code in the audio manager file is very organized and easily readable. All the variables and function names are descriptive 
	and coencide with the functionality of the variable/function

	The code in the audio manager is very high quality. It is simplistic in a good way and very easy to build on if you wanted to add new audio files.
	One thing that I might do differently to improve code quality is initialize all of the audio files in a separate class to try
	to clean the code in the file up a bit. This way there isn't a huge repetative chunk of code dedicated to initiallizing all the audio files.
